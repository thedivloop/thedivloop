- 👋 Hi, I’m Div Loop
- 👀 I’m interested in all things IT including programming, full stack web development, cyber security, Linux and much more. Despite being an humble selftaught IT enthusiast, I love to see computer science as some sort of art thanks to Uncle Bob.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning system programming as well as MERN stack (I know there is no link, but thats the beauty of IT).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and contributing as much as I can in open source projects and other platforms including MDN. Something I would love to try is pair programming as well as XP.
- 📫 Wanna get in touch, simple and basic: thedivloop@gmail.com
- If are starting and looking for some advice on what to do and where to start, feel free to nudge me.
